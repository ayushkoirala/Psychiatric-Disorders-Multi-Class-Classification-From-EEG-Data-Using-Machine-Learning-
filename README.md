# Psychiatric Disorders Multi-Class Classification From EEG Data Using Machine Learning 

This project aims to classify subjects into six main psychiatric disorders along with healthy control based on QEEG signal parameters including Power Spectrum Density (PSD) and Functional Connectivity (FC). Both Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods have been applied to the dataset. Resulting data has been analyzed to compare the accuracies achieved from ML and DL methods.

Objectives:
- To perform multi-class classification of psychiatric disorders based on QEEG signals.
- Use different types of signal parameters - PSD and FC.
- To implement different ML and DL methods on different combinations of datasets.

Hypothesis:
- Psychiatric Disorders can be classfied using EEG signal data
- Since the data is in the frequency domain, Machine Learning approach may perform better than Deep Learning.
